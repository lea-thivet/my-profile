				<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				<p>
					<br>🎹 I’m crazy about playing the piano. I love sight-read a lot of current songs by ear, without sheets music. The current songs I’ve sight-read are « Bohemian Rhapsody » of Queen and « Empire State of Mind » of Alicia Keys.</br>

					<br>📸 I really like taking photos. For instance, when I’m outside, I like taking photos of streets, sky and landscapes in general.</br>

					<br>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 & 👯‍♀️ I enjoy spending time with my friends and my family.</br>

					<br>🎶 I’m keen on listening to a lot of music. I love rap music as much as rock music as pop music.</br>

					<br>🎫 I really like going to the concerts of my favorite artists.</br>

					<br>✈️ I love travel in all over the world. The trip I had prefer was the one I made when I was in New York City.</br>

					<br>🔭 I like to be interested in astronomy.</br>

				<h2>What I would like to do later my studies</h2>
				<p>
					Later, I would like to recruit and coach people so that they know themselves and others and therefore work better together. I would like to work in different types of companies : as much in startups as in large groups but in different sectors. My goal is to use broad expertise to know how people work (among themselves but also individually) and to know problems and solutions in a company to be able to work on my own after ten years of experience maybe.
